# Introduction to Jupyter Notebook


Here, we're going to go through the Jupyter Notebook interface and figure out exactly how it's used. 

Each of the "boxes" you can see here are called "cells", and these allow you to write and run code, or take notes. Every time you make a new cells it defaults to being a "code" cell, for programming. 

However, you'll notice that this section is just plain text. This is known as a "markdown" cell, and this can be used to take notes, or even to help format reports. You can change whether a cell is in the markdown or code format using the toggle bar up the top. 

There are also a range of keyboard shortcuts that allow you to easily perform a variety of actions on these cells. You can find these under the "help" menu item, or in the "command palette" (looks like a keyboard) on the side of command toggle bar. 

These shortcuts are extremely helpful, and will allow you to easily do things like create or delete "cells", move them around the notebook, run your cells, etc. 

An external file for jupyter commands can be found on the [github](https://github.com/resbaz/introPython_July2017/blob/master/jupyterNotebook_Cheatsheet.pdf).


```python
#To "run" a cell, you can use the keyboard command Shift-Enter, 
# or the control bar

```





```python

```


```python

```

# Introduction to Python

You may have noticed while playing around that 'running' a code cell usually gives you some errors. This is because the cell didn't contain any *commands* that the computer could recognise.

A computer is very much like a dog - it can only understand and obey the commands that it's been taught to recognise

![a dog](http://janfennellthedoglistener.com/static/cms/ConfusedDog.png "When you try to give you computer human words")


Python, the programming language, is essentially just a system of commands that lets you command the computer to do the tricks that you want it to do. Imagine that your computer is like a very well trained dog that you've adopted from the shelter, and now you need to learn what commands your computer-dog responds to. Unlike the dog though, it's much easier to try and learn the commands that the computer already knows, rather than try to teach the computer how to use, say, English. We'll leave that to the AI developers.

## Scripting is just giving this dog a list of instructions

### Just like instructions to cook a meal

![image.png](attachment:image.png)

Means we have to write these instructions:

    1.) In a logical order
    2.) Explicit
    2.) written in the dogs language






Now that we're a bit more familiar with the Jupyter environment, let's play around with some Python

### Learning Objectives:
- Learn the basic numeric and string data types
- Type conversion
- Be able to apply type-specific functions to each of:
    - **Integers (int)**: 
        - Basic numeric functions: addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, power
        - Less common function: remainder/modulo, divide and floor
    - **Strings (str)**:
        - Joining two strings (concatentation), length (len), duplication
- Know how to assign something to a variable, and perform basic operations on it
    

### Data Types: Int and Float

There are two different types of ways that Python uses **_numeric_** data - whole number integers (int) and floats (floating point numbers, or decimals). 

You can do almost the same things with floats as you can with integers, except the results you get will have a greater precision.

Using numeric data types, you can do all kinds of simple (and more complex) arithmetic:


```python
# You can add and subtract numbers

```


```python
# Work with negative numbers
-5 + 2
```


```python
# As well as multiply and divide

```


```python
# You can square numbers using the "power" command, **

```


```python
# And even use a few different commands, like:
#Divide and floor, //

```


```python
# and Modulo (a.k.a the remainder), %
# Think of this one as a "divide" function that 
# returns you the amount left over after division

```

Python uses the general BODMAS/PEMDAS rules when trying to decide which order to evaluate your statements in.

What do you think would happen here?


```python
(5 + 4) / (2 * 5)

```

While it may seem as though you should use floats for everything - greater precision is better, right? - this is not always the case.

Because of the greater precision involved with floats, they take up *a lot* more space in your computer's memory than an int does. 


|Integers | ||  |Floats |
|-----------|-----------|---|--------|-----------|
| Pros | Cons || Pros | Cons | 
|less memory|no decimals||decimals|more memory|


While that doesn't matter for simple arithmetic and processes such as this, if you're working with larger files that contain a lot of information, using floats unnecessarily can slow down your program and your computer. Sometimes, it can even give you the wrong answer.

### Strings

![alt text](http://25.media.tumblr.com/c66c15ce6ad3bb8c4268e254d4d0353d/tumblr_mof2n474yG1s0teago2_400.gif "Logo Title Text 1")

The next  essential data type to know about are *strings*. String are essentially just text. You can tell Python that something is a string by wrapping it in quote marks

#### Kind of like Dr. Evil...

![Dr_evil.png](attachment:Dr_evil.png)


```python
# You can use two types of quotes: either the double ", or the single '

```


```python

```


```python
# Just remember to be consistent!
'This "quote" thing is pretty handy'
```

Since it's not a numeric type, we can't do the same things to a string that we can to an int or float. But there are a few other things we can do instead!

An example of this is concatentation, or adding two strings together. Try adding your first name and last name


```python
#Example: "FirstName" + "Last Name"
#Try it yourself! What do you notice when you add two strings?
"My"+ "name"
```

Oh no! That happened because Python doesn't automatically add in a space between two strings, which means that we have to do it ourselves. Let's try again.


```python
# We have two options, "FirstName " + "LastName"

```


```python
# Or "FirstName" + " " + "LastName"

```

We can also multiply our strings by a number to duplicate it


```python
"Mine " * 5
```

^

\* this reminds me a little of finding nemo\*
![seagulls shuouting mine](https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/9/99/Nemo-Seagulls_.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110913023141)

#### Question

What type of value (integer, floating point number, or character string) would you use to represent each of the following? Try to come up with more than one good answer for each problem. For example, in # 1, when would using a decimal make more sense than using an integer?

1. Time elapsed since the start of the year.
2. Serial number of a piece of lab equipment.
3. A lab specimen’s age.
4. Current population of a city.
5. Average population of a city over time.

### What to do with data? Lets chuck it in a function

#### You already know how to use functions!
![image.png](attachment:image.png)

**Basic form of a function in Python:** function(object or objects, arguments)

We will learn more about functions later, but for now all you need to know is that a function allows you to perform specific, and often complicated, actions on your code or data. 


### Data Type Functions

However, sometimes you *need* to know which data type you're working with. You can do this with a **function**, called `type()`.

In this instance, `type()` will output the data type that you're working with.


```python
type(4)
```


```python
type(2.6)
```


```python
type("3")
```

When using functions like this, it becomes very important to know what kind of data you're working with. 

Some functions, like `type()`, will work on all data types, but there are others that will only work on certain kinds of data.

An example of this can be seen with `len()`.

`len()`, will tell you how long your string is


```python

```


```python
# but if we try to use it on numeric data...

```

#### Errors happen folks.....

##### *Some data types and functions just don't get along*

**Follow me through the 6 stages of error grief**
    - Step 1: (Venting/Catharsis) Say a choice word about what you think about Python
    - Step 2: (Reading) Read the error
    - Step 3: (Google) Google the error or the function
    - Step 4: (Read some more) read about the error or the function and figure out what went wrong
    - Step 5: (Try the fix)
    - Step 6: (Repeat) Either get an error and return to step one, or fix it and forget about it in 3 months and make the same mistake again...

### Lets look at some more String Specific functions

#### Lets look at one:

 `upper()` - Makes every letter in the string upper case (**Who would have guessed?!**)


### What happened here?
skip to step 4 of error grief:


![image.png](attachment:image.png)


### Methods are functions specific to a certain type of object

`object.method(arguments)`

### Strings have many methods we are going to look at a couple:

https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods


```python
# Now try str.function() instead

#Upper capitalises everything
"This".upper()
```


```python
#While lower makes everything lower case
"examPlE of A StRinG".lower()
```


```python
#.capitalize() will capitalise the first letter
"examPlE of A StRinG".capitalize()
```


```python
#What do you think this might do?
"example This thing".title()
```


```python
# what happens if you try to use these on an int?
3.lower()
```

**Discussion Question**

Why is len() not a method for our strings (why wouldn't we type 'string'.len())


```python

```

### Data Type Coercion

You can also convert different data types into another using *type coercion*.

For example, say that I've done some calculations to figure out how many people can fit into an elevator, and got a decimal number, like 3.14159265359. It doesn't make much sense to have 0.14159265359 of person, does it? So I would just want to convert this into an integer.


```python
# But be warned! This ALWAYS rounds down
int(3.14159265359),int(3.6)
```


```python
float(3)
```

Type conversion will only work where it makes sense to do so. Try to turn a string into a number


```python
int("35")
```


```python
#This won't work
int("int")
```


```python
# But this one is perfectly fine
str(1000000)
```

Similarly, certain functions won't work on certain data types. Try to take the `len()` of a number, for example


```python
len(3000000)
```

Dang! But I'd forgotten how many 0's were in a million! What if you turn that number into a string first?


```python
len(str(3000000))
```


```python

```

#### Challenge 1

Which of the following will print 2.0? If they don't, what do they print instead?

1. 1.0 + float("1")
2. float("1") + float("1.1")
3. 1.0 + int("1.1")
4. 1.0 + int(float("1.1"))
5. int(1.0) + int(float("1.1"))
6. 2.0 * "1"

#### Challenge 2

What will these do? What will be the final data type in each case?

1. `str(4.0)`
2. `int(str(4.0))`
3. `float(str(3.5))`
4. `int(float(str(3.2)))`


```python
str(4.0)
```


```python
int(str(4.0))
```


```python
float(str(3.5))
```


```python
int(float(str(3.2)))
```


```python

```


```python

```


```python

```

### The Print() statement

Print statements are a handy little function that takes the data that you put into it, and then output it (as a string) to the console. This can extremely useful when trying to format some text output in a particular way - such as only using 2 decimal points of a number.


```python
# takes the value of name, adds something else to it, and then updates the old 'name' with the new value
name = "mine"
name = name + " " + "chips"

```


```python
# You can use commas in print to add different elements together without adding your own spaces
# PLUS it auto-coerces data types to strings, AND removes those awkward 'quote' marks from output
print("Kahli", "Flekac","Is","An", "Awesome", "Teacher")
```

    Kahli Flekac Is An Awesome Teacher
    

But be careful! If you're writing a large number, you might be tempted to use commas. While this is "illegal" in Python, if you were to put it in a print statement then this happens:


```python
1,000,000,000
```




    (1, 0, 0, 0)




```python
print(1,000000.5000)
print(1,000,000)
```

    1 0.5
    1 0 0
    

This is an example of a semantic, or silent, error. Python has still _worked_ - it ran your code, and gave you a valid result...but it hasn't done what you intended it to do.

A new feature of Python 3 means that you _can_ use underscores when writing numbers. How exciting!


```python
print(1_000_000)
```

### Use the % to add other data types into your print string

Another way of using print allow you to format your output in a particular way.


```python
print("%s is a str, %i is an int, and %f is a decimal/float" % ("Word",3, 4.50))
```

    Word is a str, 3 is an int, and 4.500000 is a decimal/float
    

What this essentially does is allow you substitute a value within a sentence with some formatting information - what kind of data to expect, how you want it to be presented, etc - and then specify the actual the data that's meant to go into that place afterwards.

%i = int  
  %f = float. Add numbers/decimals before the f to specify how many numbers you want to be visible  
  %s = string
  
There are plenty more, including using left/right justification of your values. There's no sense in trying to remember it all though - just google "print formatting" to find more information on how this can be used. 


```python
print("'%s' is a word with %i letters, and is %0.2f%% more useful than the word %s" \
                                                  %("Monty",len("Monty"),120.6785,"Python"))
```

    'Monty' is a word with 5 letters, and is 120.68% more useful than the word Python
    


```python

```

_**Question**_

What is wrong with the following code?


```python
print Hello world x %s, %1
```


```python

```

### Variables, or Data Nicknames

Some of these things are getting a bit lengthy though. Could you imagine needing to type out the *same* numbers, and the *same* string every time you want to use it? What about if you wanted to do some math on the number? How are you going to save that number for later?

Simple! What we can do is give our data a nickname of sorts, by assigning these values to a variable.

We can do this using the '=' sign. What this does is use Python to tell the computer to carve out a piece of memory somewhere, give it the name you told it to, and assign it a user-specified (i.e. by you) value. 


```python
# Makes "name", and gives it the value 'mine'


# tells the computer to find that piece of memory called "name", and then print out the value of it

```


```python
type(name)
```

You can perform operations and functions on it


```python
number = 3.5
print(type(number))
```

    <class 'float'>
    


```python
# What will be the answer here?
print(number**2 + 5)
```

I can also assign the results of an operation into a new variable too.


```python
number = 10
times = 3

example_operation = number * times

#What will this print out?
print(example_operation)
```

I can over-write this variable


```python
name = 'Q: Mine?'

print ("Before,",name)

name = "A: Nope!"

print("After,",name)
```

And use it in a print statement just as I would any other data type


```python
temp_number = 4
```


```python
print("Temporary = " + str(temp_number))
```

#### Challenge 3

You are given two positive numbers, `a` and `b`, which each correspond to the length of the sides of the right-angle triangle seen below

Print the number corresponding to the square of the hypotenuse (c\*\*2) of that right triangle.


i.e. given sides `a` and `b`, print `c^2`
![image.png](attachment:image.png)

Hint: if `a = 3` and `b = 4`, then the answer = 25


```python
# This will randomly generate a value for a and b between 1 to 100
from numpy import random

a = random.randint(1,100)
b = random.randint(1,100)
```


```python
# what do you need to do from here? What's a? How about b? What does the math look like?


```

### The dark art of variable Names:

![image.png](attachment:image.png)

Python has basically only three rules about naming variables:
- names you define must start with a letter (a-z,A-Z) or underscore (_) and can be followed by any number of letters, >digits (0-9), or underscores
- names you define cannot be the same as any of Python's reserved words (see below table)
- names are case-sensitive: 'YOU', 'you', 'You', and 'yOu' are all different names in Python
- Note that '-', '+', '*', and '/' are used by Python for defining operations on data and cannot be used in names


Also, try to make your variable names mean something. It can be very confusing for someone else reading your code (or even yourself, after a long break) if you write something filled with a number of different `temp` or `foo1`, `foo2`, etc variables.


| |Reserved | Words | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|False|True|None|and|
|as|assert|break|class|
|continue|class|del|def|
|if|else|elif|import|
|for|from|return|global|
|try|except|finally|raise|
|while|not|in|is|
|or|with|yield|lambda|
|pass|nonlocal| | |

#### Challenge 4

In this list of variable names, which ones are legal? Which ones are legal, but generally frowned upon? How could we make these better?

1. 76trombones = "big parade"
2. more$ = 1000000
3. class = "Computer Science 101"
4. Price_of_tea_in_china
5. my name = "Scooby Doo"
6. A_good_grade_is_A+




```python

```



#### Challenge 5
Assign your team name, how many members you have, and your average (mean) age to three separate variables. Print these out on the same line in this format:

"Our team name is TeamName. We have X members and we are, on average, Y years old"


```python

```


```python

```


```python

```


```python

```
